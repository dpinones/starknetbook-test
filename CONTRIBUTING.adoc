== The Book Structure in Antora

The Starknet Book is structured to be compatible with Antora, a static site generator. Key components include:

* `antora-playbook.yml`: Configuration for the Antora site generator (contributors don't need to edit this).
* `chapters/antora.yml`: Main outline of the book where new chapters are added (e.g., add `modules/chapter_35/nav.adoc` for Chapter 35).
* `chapters/modules/`: Contains the content of the book, with each chapter in a separate folder (e.g., `chapters/modules/chapter_35/`). Chapter folders include:
  ** `pages/`: Contains asciidoc files with the chapter content.
  ** `nav.adoc`: Contains the chapter outline and references to section files in `pages/`.
  ** `images/`: Contains images for the chapter.
  ** Other directories (e.g., `contracts/`): Contain code or other resources for the chapter.

* Use proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling. This ensures a professional appearance and makes the content easier to understand.
