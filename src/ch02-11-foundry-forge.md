# Foundry Forge: Testing ðŸš§

[Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry) is a tool designed for testing and developing Starknet contracts. It is an adaptation of the Ethereum Foundry for Starknet, aiming to expedite the development process.

The project consists of two primary components:

- **Forge**: A testing tool specifically for Cairo contracts. This tool acts as a test runner and boasts features designed to enhance your testing process. Tests are written directly in Cairo, eliminating the need for other programming languages. Additionally, the Forge implementation uses Rust, mirroring Ethereum Foundry's choice of language.
  
- **Cast**: This serves as a DevOps tool for StarkNet, initially supporting a series of commands to interface with StarkNet. In the future, Cast aims to offer deployment scripts for contracts and other DevOps functions.

## Forge

Merely deploying contracts is not the end game. Many tools have offered this capability in the past. Forge sets itself apart by hosting a Cairo VM instance, enabling the sequential execution of tests. It employs Scarb for contract compilation.

To utilize Forge, define test functions and label them with test attributes. Users can either test standalone Cairo functions or integrate contracts, dispatchers, and test contract interactions on-chain.
